# clicky-game

Clicky Game is a React memory card game. The user is presented with a set of 16 cards (4x4) and the goal is find and click on a unique card each time in an effort to get to 21 maximum. 

For the first 15 card clicks, all of the cards that have already been clicked will stay inside the display square. After the user has reached 16, a card that hasn't been clicked from the remaining hidden set of 5 cards will replace a clicked card within the display square.

React components are used to break the app into smaller parts and props containing information such as the current and high scores are passed down from the root component to components that need them.
