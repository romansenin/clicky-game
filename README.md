## Project Description
---

Clicky Game is a React memory card game. The user is presented with a set of 16 cards (4x4) and the goal is find and click on a unique card each time in an effort to get to a maximum of 21. 

For the first 15 click attempts, all of the cards that have already been clicked will stay inside the display square. Once the player achieves 16 correct cards, a card that hasn't been clicked from the remaining hidden set of 5 cards will replace a clicked card within the display square.
